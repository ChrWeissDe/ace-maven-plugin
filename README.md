# ace-maven-plugin
## About
This plugin can be used to build IBM App Connect Enterprise projects and create BAR files for deployment. You may install the plugin locally or can deploy it on the Enterprise repository server, which can be pulled during maven build of the ACE projects.

The plugin also contains a 'pom.xml'. Ensure to update the repository server url and other values appropriate to environment before building the plugin.
